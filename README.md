# emotes-forge
Emotecraft Forge

This is an abaddoned project until Forge will update it's mappings OR let us use mojang's official mappings...
(Fabric version is NOT abaddoned, just the forge version is)

I won't rewrite forgegradle to be able to do this...

If you think, you have enough time to find every unmapped stuff, fell free to fork it or the fabric version.
